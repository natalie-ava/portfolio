# Diabetes & Fracture Prevalence â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores the relationship between diabetes and fracture prevalence in a male population based in San Antonio, Texas. The goal was to better understand how age, bone health, and underlying health conditions correlate with diabetic status and fracture risk.

## Project Overview
- Merged and cleaned health-related datasets with demographic and medical variables
- Engineered new columns to reflect diabetes diagnosis, fracture presence, and calcium levels
- Used seaborn and matplotlib to create visualizations including countplots, violin plots, and correlation heatmaps

## Key Insights
- Diabetics over the age of 70 were significantly more prone to fractures
- Calcium levels tended to be lower in patients with both diabetes and fracture history
- Race and age were correlated with disparities in diabetic fracture risk

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
