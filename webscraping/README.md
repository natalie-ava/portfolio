# Web Scraping Projects

This folder contains two exploratory projects where I scraped and analyzed data from public websites: Yelp, MathJobs, and TripAdvisor. These projects focus on extracting structured insights from unstructured HTML data using Python and BeautifulSoup.

## Project Overviews

### [Data Scrape: Yelp and MathJobs](x)
Scraped restaurant listings from Yelp including:
- Names, review counts, star ratings, categories, and price levels
- Used pandas to clean and structure the data
- Explored relationships between price, category, and rating
MathJobs Academic Listing Scraping:
- Scraped job listings from MathJobs.org, including job title, institution, and posting details
- Filtered by department type and keyword matches (e.g., “Data Science”)
- Used regex and string cleaning to format text data for exploration

### [TripAdvisor Scraping](x)
Extracted data on:
- Restaurant names, locations, number of reviews, and rankings
- Identified common cuisines and average review trends
- Explored geographic concentration of highly rated restaurants

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- requests
- pandas
- matplotlib and seaborn (for visual exploration)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Web scraping from static HTML pages
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Basic EDA and trend visualization
- Working with real-world, semi-structured data

Each notebook is self-contained and includes data extraction, cleaning, and exploratory steps. These projects were completed as part of coursework and reflect growing experience in data collection from public sources.
