      <p>ArtEmotions aims to predict emotional responses to artworks by analyzing features such as art period, creation year, medium, and subject focus. Building upon the <a href="https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/wikiartemotions.html">WikiArt Emotions dataset</a>, which comprises 4,105 artworks annotated for emotions evoked in observers, this project refines the data and develops a predictive model to classify viewer reactions as positive, negative, or mixed.

    <p>
      This exploratory data analysis focuses on a male population based in San Antonio, TX to examine the relationship between diabetes, age, fracture prevalence, and bone health. I merged health-related datasets using Python and created columns to capture diabetic and fracture status. Through countplots, violin plots, and correlation heatmaps, I found that diabetics over 70 were more prone to fractures and had lower calcium levels. These insights highlight age- and race-based health disparities and support broader public health recommendations.
