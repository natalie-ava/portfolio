      <h3> <a  href = "https://github.com/natalie-ava/ArtEmotions">Art Emotions</a></h3>
      <p>ArtEmotions aims to predict emotional responses to artworks by analyzing features such as art period, creation year, medium, and subject focus. Building upon the <a href="https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/wikiartemotions.html">WikiArt Emotions dataset</a>, which comprises 4,105 artworks annotated for emotions evoked in observers, this project refines the data and develops a predictive model to classify viewer reactions as positive, negative, or mixed.

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/natalie-ava/GoogleADA_Capstone">Google's Advanced Data Analytics Capstone</a></h3>
    <p>
      An exploratory data analytics and predictive modeling capstone project created as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Specialization. This project uses logistic regression to analyze HR data and predict which employees are at risk of leaving a company. The analysis involved cleaning and preparing a dataset of 15,000 records, exploring key features such as satisfaction, workload, salary, and tenure, and developing a predictive model using Python and scikit-learn. Key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC were used to evaluate the model, along with visualizations like heatmaps and confusion matrices. Final recommendations translate model insights into recommendations for HR teams to improve retention.

    <p>
      This exploratory data analysis focuses on the relationship between diabetes, age, fracture prevalence, and bone health in a male population in San Antonio, TX. Health-related datasets were merged and processed using Python to identify diabetic and fracture status. These insights highlight age and race based health disparities and support broader public health recommendations.
