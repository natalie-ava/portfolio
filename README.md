      <h3> <a  href = "https://github.com/natalie-ava/ArtEmotions">Art Emotions</a></h3>
      <p>ArtEmotions aims to predict emotional responses to artworks by analyzing features such as art period, creation year, medium, and subject focus. Building upon the <a href="https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/wikiartemotions.html">WikiArt Emotions dataset</a>, which comprises 4,105 artworks annotated for emotions evoked in observers, this project refines the data and develops a predictive model to classify viewer reactions as positive, negative, or mixed.

    <p>
      An exploratory data analytics and predictive modeling capstone project created as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Specialization. This project uses logistic regression to analyze HR data and predict which employees are at risk of leaving a company. The analysis involved cleaning and preparing a dataset of 15,000 records, exploring key features such as satisfaction, workload, salary, and tenure, and developing a predictive model using Python and scikit-learn. Key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC were used to evaluate the model, along with visualizations like heatmaps and confusion matrices. Final recommendations translate model insights into recommendations for HR teams to improve retention.

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/natalie-ava/Diabetes-BoneFracture-EDA">Diabetes & Fracture Prevalence EDA</a></h3>
    <p>
      This project combines exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling to examine the relationship between fracture prevalence and clinical and lifestyle factors in a male population in San Antonio, TX. Health-related datasets were cleaned and merged using Python to identify key clinical indicators. Building on these insights, machine learning models were developed to predict fracture risk in diabetic men based on variables such as vitamin D, calcium, and A1C levels. This work is part of a research project in progress under the guidance of Dr. Md Raiful Islam, Assistant Professor of Data Science at the University of the Incarnate Word, and in collaboration with the UIW School of Osteopathy, with the broader goal of understanding health disparities and informing preventive care strategies.
